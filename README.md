# The minimap
 A minimap is a video games navigation tool with the main pourpose to orientate players on the game space. To understand the concept of navigation on videogames we can look at the earliest games. Most of them  like Space Invaders or Pac-Man could display all its information in one screen so the players did not need any extra information. However, from then on games have grown a lot on complexity and the idea of displaying all the info of the game in one screen was quickly abandoned. Nowadays, games favor larger environments, through scrolling or leaving one screen and entering the next. Here is where the navigations tools are impresindible to help the player keep track of the information about the complex game space like his position on it.

## Navigation tools
[This very interesting gamasutra article](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4115/no_more_wrong_turns.php?print=1 "Gamasutra article") explains very well the different types of navigation tools used on videogames. Because the pourpose of the research is specifically about the minimap I will just resume the article on this point but if you are interested on the topic deffinately check it out.
The article divides the navigation tools between discrete and immersed. On one hand, the discrete navigation tools are the ones that are part of the Graphical User Interface, making them very noticeable. In this category we find the minimap, the marker and the compass.

On the other hand, the immerse navigation tools are a part of the game environment. The article classifies them between the categories of attract, identify and guide.
## Minimap
After having introduced the navigation tools now it is time to focus on the minimap.The minimap is a small, simplified version of a larger map. This plays a vital role in many games, especially Real Time Strategy, where it is important to have an overview of the entire map. As part of the discrete navigation tools it is a part of the graphical user interface. Appart from orienting players on the space it also can display a lot of other game information like allies, enemies, buildings, terrain, communication symbols, coordinates, objectives, items...

### Which games need a minimap
Having the capacity of displaying so many information simplified together is the biggest advantage of minimaps however there is a downside to it. The main issue of minimaps is that they can affect the immersion of the game a lot. They display so much information that the players can play some games and spend most of the time just looking at the minimap losing a lot of the immersive experience.
Continiously I will show two videos about two gameplays of two FPS games using eyetraker, one with minimap and the other without it. Pay attention to how much time the minimap game player spends looking at it.
