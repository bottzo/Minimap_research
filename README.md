# The minimap
 A minimap is a video games navigation tool with the main pourpose to orientate players on the game space. To understand the concept of navigation on videogames we can look at the earliest games. Most of them  like Space Invaders or Pac-Man could display all its information in one screen so the players did not need any extra information. However, from then on games have grown a lot on complexity and the idea of displaying all the info of the game in one screen was quickly abandoned. Nowadays, games favor larger environments, through scrolling or leaving one screen and entering the next. Here is where the navigations tools are impresindible to help the player keep track of the information about the complex game space like his position on it.

## Navigation tools
[This very interesting gamasutra article](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4115/no_more_wrong_turns.php?print=1 "Gamasutra article") explains very well the different types of navigation tools used on videogames. Because the pourpose of the research is specifically about the minimap I will just resume the article on this point but if you are interested on the topic deffinately check it out.
The article divides the navigation tools between discrete and immersed. On one hand, the discrete navigation tools are the ones that are part of the Graphical User Interface, making them very noticeable. In this category we find the minimap, the marker and the compass.

On the other hand, the immerse navigation tools are a part of the game environment. The article classifies them between the categories of attract, identify and guide.
