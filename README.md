# Minimap Research
This is a research project about the topic of minimaps on videogames for the project 2 subject at UPC videogames degree.
The research aims to provide the basic understanding about minimaps to be able to implement a minimap for an RTS game.
The research includes a [webpage](https://bottzo.github.io/Minimap_research/ "GitHub web") where you will find all the information found on the research and also a code implementation of a minimap with TODOs to try to code it yourself.

I am Jordi Bach a student of the degree in Video Game Design and Development for the UPC on Barcelona.
